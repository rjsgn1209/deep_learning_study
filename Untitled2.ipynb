So what\\'s the deal with you and Marlene, anyways?\\nEllie: I don\\'t know. She\\'s my friend, I guess.\\nJoel: Your friend, huh? You\\'re friends with the leader of the Fireflies.\\nEllie: She knew my mom, and she\\'s been looking after me. And I\\'m fourteen, not\\nJoel: So where are your parents?\\nEllie: Where are anyone\\'s parents? They\\'ve been gone a long, long time.\\nJoel: Hm. So instead of just staying in school, you decide to run off and join\\nEllie: Look, I\\'m not supposed to tell you why you\\'re smuggling me, if that\\'s\\nJoel: You wanna know the best thing about my job? I don\\'t gotta know why. Be\\nEllie: Well great.\\nJoel: Good.\\nJoel: This is it.\\nEllie: What are you doing?\\nJoel: Killing time.\\nEllie: Well, what am I supposed to do?\\nJoel: I am sure you will figure that out.\\nEllie: Your watch is broken.\\nEllie: You mumble in your sleep.

We weren\\'t the first choice, or the\\nJoel: Yeah, let\\'s just hope there\\'s someone alive to pay us.\\nTess: Someone\\'ll be around. Come on.\\nJoel: Who\\'s waitin\\' for us at the drop-off?\\nTess: She said there\\'s some Fireflies that have traveled all the way from\\nEllie: Something like that. How long is this all gonna take?\\nTess: If everything goes as planned, we should get you to them in a few hours.\\nEllie: Yeah, of course.\\nTess: Climb up and check if the coast is clear.\\nJoel: Now hold up. There\\'s a patrol up ahead. Alright, we\\'re good.

Let\\'s say that we deliver you to the Fireflies,\\nEllie: Marlene... She said that they have their own little quarantine zone.\\nJoel: Yeah, we\\'ve heard that before, huh, Tess?\\nEllie: And that...whatever happened to me is the key to finding a vaccine.\\nJoel: Oh, Jesus.\\nEllie: It\\'s what she said.\\nJoel: Oh, I\\'m sure she did.\\nEllie: Hey, fuck you, man. I didn\\'t ask for this.\\nJoel: Me neither. Tess, what the hell are we doing here?\\nTess: What if it\\'s true?\\nJoel: I can\\'t believe--\\nTess: What if, Joel? I mean we\\'ve come this far, let\\'s just finish it.\\nJoel: Do I need to remind you what is out there?\\nTess: I get it. This way. If we cut through downtown, we can hit the capitol\\nJoel: We hope.\\nEllie: Holy moley. I guess this is what these buildings look like up close.\\nTess: They bombed the hell out of the surrounding areas to the quarantine\\nEllie: Ahhh, what the hell was that?\\nJoel: Tess, do you hear that?\\nTess: Yeah. Sounded pretty far away though.\\nJoel: Shit.\\nEllie: Are we safe?\\nTess: For now. Come on.\\nEllie: Damn. That\\'s quite a drop.\\nJoel: Well, there\\'s the capitol building.\\nTess: Yeah, we need to get around this mess.\\nEllie: This is the downtown area?\\nTess: It was. Now it\\'s a giant wasteland.\\nJoel: Over here.\\nJoel: You find anything over there?\\nTess: No.\\nJoel: Keep looking.\\nEllie: Should I do anything?\\nJoel: You just stay close to her for now.\\nEllie: Roger dodger.\\nJoel: Hey, Tess.\\nTess: Comin\\'.\\nTess: He\\'s been ripped apart.\\nJoel: Yeah...\\nTess: Body\\'s pretty fresh.\\nEllie: Is that bad?\\nTess: Yeah, might be... Let\\'s not stick around.\\nTess: Another one. Shit.\\nJoel: Looks like these guys died waiting for backup.\\nJoel: Goddammit. Clicker.\\nEllie: Geez. What\\'s wrong with its face?\\nTess: That\\'s what years of infection\\'ll do to you.\\nEllie: So what, are they...blind?\\nTess: Sort of. They see using sound.\\nEllie: Like bats.\\nTess: Like bats. If you hear one clicking, you gotta hide. That\\'s how they\\nEllie: Shit.\\nJoel: Whole building feels like it\\'s about to fall apart.\\nEllie: Totally cool. Everything is totally cool.\\nJoel: Gimme a hand with this.\\nEllie: Joel!\\nJoel: Thanks...\\nEllie: You alright?\\nJoel: It\\'s nothin\\'.\\nTess: Let\\'s search for supplies.\\nEllie: Shit! Oh, that was so intense.\\nTess: You said it. Here, patch yourself up.\\nJoel: C\\'mon. Let\\'s get the hell outta here.\\nTess: Up there, look.\\nEllie: Yeesh...\\nJoel: Just see if there\\'s a way through.\\nTess: Okay... It\\'s clear.

Should we go back up?\\nTess: Ahh, this is crazy. Just don\\'t look down.\\nEllie: Wha--? Are you serious?\\nTess: C\\'mon, Ellie.\\nEllie: Yeah... Don\\'t look down. Don\\'t look down.\\nTess: You\\'re okay. We got a way through.\\nJoel: Oh boy...\\nTess: Runners.\\nJoel: I\\'ll go check it out. Stay with the girl.\\nJoel: Alright. Come on down.\\nTess: I\\'m impressed, Joel.\\nJoel: Pssh. Let\\'s just get outta here.\\nJoel: Alright. Tess, go.\\nTess: Alright, hold on. Here -- this\\'ll work. Alright, gimme a hand, Ellie.\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nEllie: Okay... Alright, that should do it.\\nTess: There, see? We\\'re doin\\' alright.\\nJoel: Mm-hmm.\\nEllie: Whoa.\\nTess: Down we go.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get to it. We can get through here. Watch your back.\\nTess: You know, I was thinkin\\'...after we get back, we can take it easy for a\\nJoel: You want to take it easy?\\nTess: Hey, you\\'re the one who\\'s always going on about layin\\' low.\\nJoel: And you always brushed me off.\\nTess: Well, I won\\'t this time.\\nJoel: I\\'ll believe it when I see it. Through here.\\nTess: Joel, over here.\\nTess: Look at his sleeve. Firefly.\\nJoel: These guys aren\\'t doin\\' too well in or out of the city. Let\\'s hope\\nJoel: They\\'re from the quarantine zone.\\nTess: See...they\\'re not our guys.\\nJoel: Over there, see it?\\nTess: Shit. God, we\\'re almost out. Okay, Joel, you take point. I\\'ll watch the\\nEllie: Sure.\\nJoel: This way. We\\'re almost out. C\\'mon.\\nTess: Yeah, go over there. Quick, before it comes back.\\nJoel: Alright. C\\'mon.\\nJoel: Get up here.\\nEllie: Holy shit. We actually made it.\\nJoel: Everyone okay?\\nTess: Yes. Let\\'s move.\\nEllie: You guys are pretty good at this stuff.\\nJoel: It\\'s called luck, and it is gonna run out. Which way we goin\\', Tess?\\nTess: Uh...capitol building\\'s in this direction. How do we get up over this\\nJoel: Climb on up. Maybe we can cut through here.\\nEllie: Yeah, that worked out great last time. Sorry -- I\\'m just sayin\\'.\\nTess: Shhh-shh.\\nJoel: What? I don\\'t hear anything.\\nTess: Okay, double time.\\nJoel: Oh, shit....\\nEllie: Oh -- they\\'re coming.\\nJoel: I know.\\nTess: Okay, that\\'s good, that\\'s good. Go.\\nEllie: Okay, Joel.\\nJoel: Drop it!\\nEllie: Oh...you got something on your shoe.\\nEllie: Gross.\\nJoel: Okay. How do we get out of this place?\\nTess: Let\\'s find out. So Marlene thinks your immune?\\nEllie: Well, that\\'s what she believes.\\nTess: Well, how were you bitten? I mean you must\\'ve been somewhere you\\nEllie: Yeah, I\\'d sneak out. I was in this military boarding school.\\nTess: You\\'d sneak out?\\nEllie: You know, explore the city. I was in the mall when I ran into infected.\\nTess: That place is completely off-limits. How the hell did you get in there?\\nEllie: I...had my ways. Anyways, one of those -- what you guys call runners\\nTess: I see. Were you with Marlene when you were bitten?\\nEllie: No. I went to her for help afterwards.\\nTess: Knowing her, I\\'m surprised she didn\\'t shoot you.\\nEllie: She almost did. Hope she\\'s alright.\\nTess: I told you. She\\'s gonna be fine.\\nEllie: Ow. Shit. Sorry, sorry. That was me.\\nJoel: Tess.\\nEllie: Sorry!\\nTess: C\\'mon. Stay close to me.\\nEllie: What is this place?\\nTess: It\\'s an old museum. Some of these things are hundreds of years old.\\nEllie: Really? Wow.\\nJoel: Alright, watch your head. Hurry. Go, go, go. Shit...sonofa...\\nTess: Joel. Joel!\\nJoel: I\\'m alive. I\\'ll make my way around to you.\\nEllie: Oh... Look they\\'re here!\\nJoel: Tess?\\nTess: Run. Run!\\nJoel: Shit.\\nJoel: Tess.\\nTess: Ellie, stay back!\\nJoel: Tess!\\nTess: I\\'m fine.\\nEllie: Guys, get in here!\\nTess: The girl!\\nJoel: Shit.\\nJoel: That was too damn close.\\nTess: Oh shit.\\nJoel: Tess, how\\'re you holdin\\' up?\\nTess: Just a bit winded. This way. This\\'ll get us to the roof.\\nJoel: How \\'bout you, kid? You okay?\\nEllie: Define okay.\\nJoel: Are you still breathing?\\nEllie: Do small, panicked breaths count?\\nJoel: Yeah, they count.\\nEllie: Alright. Then I\\'m okay.\\nTess: We gotta find a way across. There she is. That\\'s our building.\\nJoel: Alright. Now watch your step as you goin\\' up \\'cause it\\'s gonna be a\\nEllie: Pssh.\\nJoel: Well, is that everything you hoped for?\\nEllie: Jury\\'s still out. But, man...you can\\'t deny that view.\\nTess: C\\'mon. This way. Hey! Pick it up. Look, we\\'re almost done. Stay focused.\\nJoel: Yes, ma\\'am.\\nTess: It\\'s right around this corner. C\\'mon.\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep moving, kid.\\nJoel: There we go. Home stretch, Tess.\\nEllie: Um...just so it\\'s out there. I can\\'t swim.\\nTess: Look, it looks like it\\'s shallow on the right side. Follow me.\\nEllie: I\\'m glad Marlene hired you guys.\\nTess: What do you mean?\\nEllie: I know you guys are getting paid for this -- but I\\'m trying to say\\nTess: Yeah, sure thing.\\nTess: No. No, no.\\nEllie: What happens now?\\nJoel: What are you doing, Tess?\\nTess: Oh, god. Maybe they, ah, maybe they had a map or something to tell us\\nJoel: How far are we gonna take this?\\nTess: As far as it needs to go. Where was this lab of theirs?\\nEllie: She never said. She only mentioned it was someplace out west.\\nJoel: What are we doing here? This is not us.\\nTess: What do you know about us? About me?\\nJoel: I know that you are smarter than this.\\nTess: Really? Guess what, we\\'re shitty people, Joel. It\\'s been that way for a\\nJoel: No, we are survivors!\\nTess: This is our chance--\\nJoel: It is over, Tess! Now we tried. Let\\'s just go home.\\nTess: I\\'m not...I\\'m not going anywhere. This is my last stop.\\nJoel: What?\\nTess: Our luck had to run out sooner or later.\\nJoel: What are you going on about--\\nTess: No don\\'t-- Don\\'t touch me.\\nEllie: Holy shit. She\\'s infected.\\nTess: Joel...\\nJoel: Let me see it.\\nTess: I didn\\'t mean for this--\\nJoel: Show it to me.\\nJoel: Oh, Christ.\\nTess: Oops, right? Give me your arm.\\nTess: This was three weeks. I was bitten an hour ago and it\\'s already worse.\\nJoel: No, no, no, that was your crusade. I am not doin\\' that.\\nTess: Yes you are. Look, there\\'s enough here that you have to feel some sort\\nEllie: Shit.\\nTess: Oh...\\nGuard: Watch the exit!\\nTess: They\\'re here.\\nJoel: Dammit.\\nTess: I can buy you some time, but you have to run.\\nEllie: What? You want us to just leave you here?\\nTess: Yes.\\nJoel: There is no way that--\\nTess: I will not turn into one of those things. Come on. Make this easy for me.\\nJoel: I can fight--\\nTess: No, just go! Just fucking go.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t -- I didn\\'t mean for this.\\nJoel: Get a move on.\\nGuard: We know you\\'re in there! Drop your weapons and come out with your hands\\nEllie: What the fuck! I can\\'t believe we did that.\\nJoel: Stop.\\nEllie: We just left her to die.\\nJoel: Stop. You stay close to me. We need to move.\\nEllie: Oh man...\\nJoel: Just keep pushing forward.\\nEllie: Oh my god. Tess...\\nGuard: Target neutralized. She took out two of my men. Copy that. You, take\\nGuard 2: Yes, sir.\\nEllie: They\\'re gonna be here soon.\\nJoel: We\\'re through.\\nEllie: What do we do? Joel?\\nJoel: I got this.\\nEllie: What\\'re we doing? Joel, how\\'re we gonna get outta here?\\nJoel: Alright. We\\'re gonna have to go through that hall.\\nGuard: They had to come through here. Comb the area.\\nJoel: Stay down. I don\\'t know how many more there are.\\nGuard: They still haven\\'t found the last two.\\nGuard 2: I heard one of \\'em was a kid.\\nGuard: Does it matter? They took out a bunch of our guys.\\nGuard 2: Jesus. Well hey, after today this whole Firefly bullshit will be\\nEllie: Joel, there\\'s the exit.\\nJoel: I see it.\\nEllie: There\\'s stairs over there.\\nJoel: Stay low.\\nGuard: They\\'re going into the subway! Stop \\'em!\\nJoel: Shit.\\nEllie: They\\'re following us!\\nJoel: Goddammit.\\nEllie: Get down.\\nGuard: No target. I repeat, no target.\\nEllie: There\\'s a soldier over there.\\nRadio: Understood. Hold your position and wait for reinforcements.\\nGuard: Copy that. Holding position.\\nJoel: How the hell are you breathin\\' in this stuff?\\nEllie: I wasn\\'t lying to you.\\nGuard 2: Did you spot \\'em?\\nGuard: No, place is empty.\\nGuard 2: Let\\'s find them and get the hell out of here before clickers show up.\\nEllie: Hey, uh, I can\\'t swim.\\nJoel: We\\'ll figure something out.\\nEllie: Hey look, it still works.\\nJoel: There\\'s a ladder. Maybe we can use that.\\nJoel: Get on.\\nEllie: Really?\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: Okay, okay. Ah, be careful.\\nJoel: I gotcha.\\nJoel: I got it. Alright, let\\'s get outta here.\\nEllie: Hey, look, um...about Tess... I don\\'t even know what to--\\nJoel: Here\\'s how this thing\\'s gonna play out. You don\\'t bring up Tess -- ever.\\nEllie: Sure.\\nJoel: Repeat it.\\nEllie: What you say, goes.\\nJoel: Good. Now, there\\'s a town a few miles north of here. There\\'s a fella\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get a move on.\\nJoel: Now there we go... Yeah, it\\'ll be faster to go through here.\\nEllie: Man...\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: Nothing. It\\'s just...I\\'ve never seen anything like this, that\\'s all.\\nJoel: You mean the woods?\\nEllie: Yeah. Never walked through the woods. It\\'s kinda cool.\\nEllie: Why don\\'t you just take me back to Marlene?\\nJoel: If she was up to the task, why\\'d she drop you off on us?\\nEllie: Well, maybe she\\'s better now.\\nJoel: Kid, I don\\'t mean to upset you, but your friend\\'s chances of survival\\nEllie: She\\'s a lot tougher than you think.\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter. \\'Cause I doubt I could get either one of us back into\\nEllie: Whoa. Hey, buddy.\\nJoel: Well, shit.\\nEllie: Should we climb it?\\nJoel: No, wire on top of it. We gotta find a way to go around.\\nEllie: Whoa, look. Fireflies. I mean, real fireflies.\\nJoel: Yeah, I see that.\\nEllie: Sorry, I...I lost myself for a sec.\\nJoel: Here we go.\\nJoel: That you, Bill?\\nEllie: Where do you usually meet him?\\nJoel: Huh? Different places.\\nEllie: You\\'ve never been here, have you?\\nJoel: I know this is where he lives, but...no, I ain\\'t never been here\\nEllie: And that smoke, you think that\\'s him?\\nJoel: Sure as hell better be.\\nEllie: Well, let\\'s go check it out then.\\nJoel: Alright, come on. Down here. Watch your step; it\\'s a good drop.\\nJoel: Are you alright?\\nEllie: I\\'m trying to learn how to whistle.\\nJoel: You don\\'t know how to whistle?\\nEllie: Well does it sound like I know how to whistle?\\nJoel: Oh, shit. It\\'s jammed from the other side.\\nEllie: Here, boost me up.\\nJoel: No, that\\'s not such a good idea.\\nEllie: Well, I can\\'t boost you up. How else are we gonna open it?\\nJoel: Alright. Gimme your foot. Now just open it. Nothing else.\\nEllie: Sure thing.\\nJoel: Careful.\\nEllie: Okay. Ah, let\\'s see. Okay. Ta-da.\\nJoel: Good job.\\nEllie: Thank you. So, let\\'s say we get a car from this buddy of yours. Then\\nJoel: Well, then we go find Tommy.\\nEllie: Marlene said he\\'s your brother.\\nJoel: And more importantly he was a Firefly. He\\'d know where to take you.\\nEllie: Oh, okay.\\nJoel: He lives far from here which is why we need the car.\\nEllie: Hey, look. Gnomes.\\nJoel: Yeah. Those are gnomes.\\nEllie: Man, I had an art book filled with these. I always thought they were\\nJoel: Alright, then.\\nEllie: Oh...look at that.\\nJoel: What, you play this before?\\nEllie: Nah. But I had a friend that knew everything about this game.\\nJoel: Well, I was never a big fan of these things.\\nEllie: I wish I could play it.\\nEllie: \"Mandatory evacuation.\" Evacuate to where?\\nJoel: Where you think? Quarantine zone. See, some places got a head\\'s up\\nEllie: Man, must be hard. Just...leaving all your stuff behind like that.\\nJoel: That ain\\'t the hard part.\\nJoel: Hmm. Yeah, that\\'s Bill\\'s handiwork.\\nEllie: Anybody else live in this town?\\nJoel: Far as I know, it\\'s just him.\\nEllie: Fireflies were everywhere, huh?\\nJoel: Yeah, they were. Hoping to restore the country to what it was.\\nEllie: Well...with a vaccine, maybe they will.\\nJoel: Maybe.\\nJoel: Jesus!\\nEllie: Whoa, Nelly. Wha--? What the hell was that?\\nJoel: That...would be one of Bill\\'s traps.\\nEllie: Your friend a bit paranoid, maybe?\\nJoel: Now that\\'s putting it lightly.\\nEllie: What\\'s the deal with this guy?\\nJoel: Well, he helped us smuggle stuff into the city. He\\'s... He knows how to\\nEllie: Well let\\'s hope we don\\'t blow up trying to find him.\\nJoel: Just watch your step. You\\'ll be fine.\\nEllie: Geez. Bill good with a bow?\\nJoel: I reckon he is.\\nJoel: Hey... Look at that.\\nEllie: Let me use that. I\\'m a pretty good shot with that thing.\\nJoel: How \\'bout we just leave this kind of stuff to me.\\nEllie: Well, we could both be armed. Cover each other.\\nJoel: I don\\'t think so.\\nJoel: Here, we can actually use this. It\\'s all clear, come on up.\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Let\\'s give this baby a whirl.\\nEllie: Oh fuck.\\nJoel: Now, listen. Bill ain\\'t exactly the most stable of individuals. So when\\nEllie: I understand.\\nJoel: We gotta be clear on this. He... He don\\'t take too kindly to strangers.\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Bill\\'s a good guy, he just definitely needs some time warming up to you,\\nJoel: See that wire? Stay underneath it okay? Just keep your head low and\\nEllie: Alright.\\nEllie: You hear that?\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nEllie: Oh, shit, you\\'re gonna go in there?\\nJoel: I wanna see what we can find.\\nEllie: You\\'re gonna find my body when I die from a heart attack.\\nJoel: Don\\'t worry.

It\\'s got some juice in it.\\nBill: That\\'s my battery. That fuckin\\' asshole. Get out. Get out.\\nEllie: Okay, geez.\\nBill: Battery\\'s drained but the cells are alive.\\nJoel: Meaning?\\nBill: Meaning we push it, get it started and the alternator will recharge the\\nJoel: Is that your guess?\\nBill: Look, you wanted a \"plan B.\" This is as good as it gets.\\nEllie: What\\'re you thinking?\\nJoel: Thinkin\\' you drive and we push.\\nBill: Jesus...that\\'s more of my stuff.

See, this could\\'ve been us.\\nEllie: Man, that is a lot of people that didn\\'t make it.\\nJoel: I knew I should\\'ve turned the damn truck around.\\nEllie: We lived.\\nJoel: Barely. C\\'mon, let\\'s get outta here.\\nEllie: How did you know?\\nJoel: Know what?\\nEllie: About the ambush.\\nJoel: I\\'ve been on both sides.\\nEllie: Oh. So, ah, you kill a lot of innocent people?\\nEllie: I\\'ll take that as a yes.\\nJoel: Take it however you want.\\nEllie: I guess this is where the assholes sleep. I mean slept.\\nEllie: Oh, I don\\'t think these guys were infected.\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter. Let\\'s just keep moving.\\nJoel: Hey, Ellie, slow down. Wait for me.\\nEllie: What? I\\'m right here.\\nJoel: How \\'bout you let me go first? And keep your voice down.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nEllie: I\\'m whistling.\\nJoel: Oh, good. Something else you can annoy me with.\\nEllie: That\\'s awesome.\\nEllie: What happened here? Your fellow hunters do this?\\nJoel: Cute. And no, my money\\'s on the military.\\nEllie: Why would they mow down all these people?\\nJoel: Can\\'t let everyone in.\\nEllie: So they killed them?\\nJoel: And dead people don\\'t get infected. You sacrifice the few to save the\\nEllie: It\\'s kinda shitty.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nEllie: What was that?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know. Ellie, get down.\\nHunter: Where did you learn to shoot?\\nHunter 2: Man, screw you.\\nHunter: You had an entire flock and hit nothing.\\nHunter 2: I\\'m about to hit you.\\nHunter: Wow...yeah, you\\'re really upset. Well if you want some lessons, I\\'m\\nHunter 2: Yeah, whatever.\\nHunter 3: Where the hell are those guys? They\\'re supposed to be here.\\nHunter: They\\'re on the highway shift. Wouldn\\'t be surprised if they caught\\nHunter 3: Spot\\'s a goldmine. Lucky bastards.\\nHunter: See if there\\'s anything you can forage while we wait for them.\\nHunter 3: Ain\\'t nothin\\' here. Let\\'s keep going.\\nHunter: Screw this. I ain\\'t waiting any longer. Let\\'s go see what those\\nHunter 2: They pull this crap every time. I swear to god, if they\\'re holding\\nHunter: Yeah. And you\\'ll do what?\\nHunter 2: You\\'ll see.\\nHunter: Yeah, I will see.\\nEllie: Hey, we can climb the bus right here. Okay, we need to lighten the\\nJoel: What is that?\\nEllie: A joke book. No Pun Intended: Volume Too by Will Livingston.\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep going.\\nEllie: \"What did the Confederate soldiers use to eat off of? Civil ware.\"\\nJoel: Uh-huh.\\nEllie: \"What did they use to drink with? Cups. Dixie cups.\" \"I walked into my\\nJoel: That\\'s awful.\\nEllie: You\\'re awful.\\nJoel: Do you even understand what that means?\\nEllie: Nope. Doesn\\'t matter. Alright, I\\'m done...for now.\\nEllie: That bridge looks pretty far.\\nJoel: We\\'ll get there.\\nEllie: Whoa. It\\'s strange seeing a checkpoint with no soldiers.\\nJoel: This is what most zones look like. This place has been abandoned for a\\nEllie: \"Give us our rations.\" Why wouldn\\'t they give them their food?\\nJoel: Sometimes they ran out. Most times they just held onto it.\\nEllie: That never happened in Boston.\\nJoel: Trust me, it happened all the time.\\nEllie: I hear hunters.\\nJoel: Yeah, me too. Let\\'s keep it down while we\\'re going through this area.\\nHunter: Oh...I\\'m so fucking tired. We were up all night chasing this tourist.\\nHunter 2: Oh, you were part of that? I heard about this.\\nHunter: Yeah, this one chick, she would just not give up. I\\'ve never seen\\nHunter 2: Jesus. Sometimes you gotta earn your keep.\\nHunter: Yeah, I guess. We were about to give up when she started shooting at\\nHunter 2: Damn. Maybe you shoulda kept her. Y\\'know, made her one of us.\\nHunter: No, no way. That girl -- she\\'d a killed us all in our sleep.\\nHunter 3: Bossman says we\\'re getting big enough to expand.\\nHunter 4: New head honcho...same bullshit talk.\\nHunter 3: I don\\'t know. Now that we have enough people watching all the exits,\\nHunter 4: What is that really gonna give us?\\nHunter 3 : I don\\'t know, maybe we find some more gas, get some more generators\\nHunter 4: That shit ain\\'t happening. I\\'ve heard that expansion talk way too\\nHunter 3: How do you know? Maybe things\\'ll be different now.\\nHunter 4: Keep your expectations in check, youngun. You\\'ll live longer.\\nJoel: That was too damn close.\\nEllie: The edge of the universe and back. Endure and survive.\\nJoel: Excuse me?\\nEllie: Savage Starlight. That comic I\\'ve been reading? It\\'s what the hero says\\nJoel: Endure and survive?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Man, look at all these books. I wish I had more room in my backpack.\\nJoel: So you\\'re a reader, huh?\\nEllie: Well, when I\\'m not running away from hunters or infected? Yeah, I read\\nJoel: I get it.\\nEllie: \"A moon rock tastes better than an earthly rock...because it\\'s meteor.\"\\nJoel: Do you even get that?\\nEllie: Of course not. \"I used to be addicted to soap, but I\\'m clean now.\"\\nJoel: Alright, I\\'ve actually never heard that one.\\nEllie: That\\'s it...that\\'s all I got. Now what?\\nEllie: Man, you\\'d gotta be crazy to string up soldiers.\\nJoel: You get people desperate enough, they\\'ll do just about anything.\\nEllie: And the people that rose up...they\\'re the ones we\\'ve been fighting here?\\nJoel: That\\'d be my bet. Let\\'s see where this leads us. Watch yourself on these\\nJoel: Down, down, down, down. There\\'s more of \\'em.\\nHunter: Careful with that plank.\\nHunter 2: Let\\'s get outta here.\\nJoel: Alright. I don\\'t think they saw us.\\nEllie: Whew. There\\'s our bridge. We\\'re a little closer, I think.\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep at it. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: That girl is so skinny. I thought you had plenty of food in your time.\\nJoel: We did. Some just chose to not eat it.\\nEllie: Why the hell not?\\nJoel: For looks.\\nEllie: Pssh. That\\'s stupid.\\nEllie: I think we can use some good ol\\' pun humor. \"3.14% of sailors are pi\\nJoel: 3.14...\\nEllie: \"I stayed up all night wondering where the sun went. Then it dawned on\\nJoel: I get it.\\nEllie: \"What did the mermaid wear to her math class?\"\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: \"An algae bra.\"\\nJoel: Terrible.\\nEllie: \"Why did the scarecrow get a promotion?\"\\nJoel: Alright.\\nEllie: \"Because he was outstanding in his field.\"\\nJoel: That\\'ll do. Put that thing away.\\nEllie: Okay. I\\'m all joked out.\\nJoel: I can\\'t make that jump.\\nEllie: If you get me up there, I can move that plank.\\nJoel: Wait here! Let\\'s see where this goes.\\nJoel: What the hell? Oh, this place is bad.\\nEllie: What the hell was that all about?\\nJoel: Get on. We\\'re cuttin\\' through the hotel.\\nEllie: Um...okay...\\nJoel: Set that plank like they did.\\nEllie: Alright. Now you just need to find a way up.\\nEllie: Oh, this place stinks.\\nJoel: Yeah, wood\\'s all rotten.\\nEllie: Did you go to coffee shops a lot?\\nJoel: I did. All the time.\\nEllie: And what would you get?\\nJoel: Just...just coffee.\\nEllie: Do you think those hunters are gone?\\nJoel: We\\'re about to find out.\\nJoel: It\\'s clear, Ellie. Come on down.\\nEllie: Whoa...this is fancy. Ever stay in a place like this? Before it all\\nJoel: No...no, this is too rich for my blood.\\nEllie: Oh. I bet it was nice. I bet we can get up there.\\nJoel: No, it\\'s too high. Let\\'s see what we can find.\\nJoel: Ahhh, I really miss coffee.\\nEllie: Oh, I\\'ll be checking in for one night and I\\'d like your finest suite\\nJoel: The hell are you doin\\'?\\nEllie: Why yes, you can take my luggage upstairs.\\nJoel: You are a weird kid.\\nJoel: Come on up. Watch your step.\\nEllie: Okay, it\\'s time to lighten the mood. \"I tried to catch some fog earlier.\\nJoel: Left?\\nEllie: Yeah. That\\'s awesome. \"What does a pirate say while eating sushi?\"\\nJoel: I don\\'t know, what?\\nEllie: \"Ahoy! Pass me some soy!\" I don\\'t get it. \"People are making up\\nJoel: Oh shit. Get down, get down.\\nHunter: Grr, this tourist put up a hell of a fight. It took two of us to put\\nHunter 2: Wait, how many is that now?\\nHunter: Hmm, five just this week. But hey, I\\'m not complaining.\\nHunter 2: I bet you\\'re not. We done here?\\nHunter: We got another floor to check, man.\\nHunter 2: Check for what? I ain\\'t seen a clicker in weeks.\\nHunter: That\\'s \\'cause we\\'re thorough. We\\'re gonna keep being thorough. Now\\nHunter 2: Alright, whatever.\\nHunter 3: Hey, how \\'bout we take a little food break?\\nHunter 4: Nah, maybe in like an hour or so. We can eat something before heading\\nHunter 3: Sounds good.\\nHunter 4: Got some extra dried fruit if you want.\\nHunter 3: I\\'ll take you up on that.\\nEllie: Oh, creepy. Guess they took the easy way out, huh?\\nJoel: It ain\\'t easy -- for many it was better than letting a clicker or hunter\\nJoel: Let\\'s see where this goes.\\nEllie: Just in case.\\nJoel: It\\'s gonna be a tight fit, but come on.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: You find something to climb on. Okay, here we go.\\nEllie: Alright...\\nJoel: Here we go.\\nEllie: Oh shit! Joel! Joel!\\nJoel: I\\'m alright! Are you okay?\\nEllie: No! You scared the shit outta me! I\\'m...I\\'m gonna climb down there,\\nJoel: No! Stay up there. I\\'ll make my way up to you!\\nEllie: Don\\'t do anything stupid!\\nJoel: I\\'ll try.\\nJoel: Maybe that way. That could be it.\\nJoel: Goddamnit. I don\\'t think I tried over there yet.\\nJoel: Over there. I need to find a way around this gate. Well, maybe that\\nJoel: Oh shit.\\nJoel: I hate these things.\\nJoel: Goddammit!\\nJoel: Made it. Ah, so much for that. I gotta find Ellie.\\nHunter: It\\'s down. Finish it!\\nHunter 2: I got it.\\nHunter: Nicely done. You bit?\\nHunter 2: Not today. You?\\nHunter: Not today. Alright...spread out and make sure we didn\\'t miss any more\\nEllie: Man...I shot the hell outta that guy, huh?\\nJoel: Yeah, you sure did.\\nEllie: I feel sick.\\nJoel: Why didn\\'t you just hang back like I told you to?\\nEllie: Well, you\\'re glad I didn\\'t, right?\\nJoel: I\\'m glad I didn\\'t get my head blown off by a goddamn kid.\\nEllie: You know what? No. How about \"Hey, Ellie. I know it wasn\\'t easy, but it\\nJoel: We gotta get going.\\nEllie: Lead the way.\\nJoel: We need to get back out. Find that bridge.\\nEllie: Just tell me where to go.\\nJoel: I hate this crap.\\nEllie: Wow, look at that.\\nJoel: That\\'s a backdrop. People would take their pictures in front of it.\\nEllie: Yeah, I know what it is.\\nJoel: Okay, then. Something on your mind, Ellie?\\nEllie: I wasn\\'t trying to disobey you back there. You were taking a really\\nJoel: It don\\'t matter what you thought. I need you to listen to me.\\nEllie: I do. It\\'s just that... Whatever, Joel.\\nJoel: That door looks like a way out. Hey, you see a way to get up there?\\nEllie: Nope.\\nJoel: Might be able to get through with this. Alright... Goddamn, this is\\nEllie: You sure you can trust me with that?\\nJoel: Ellie... Push.\\nEllie: I am.\\nJoel: Push harder!\\nEllie: There. How\\'s that?\\nJoel: Let\\'s go.\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nHunter: They haven\\'t gotten back yet. What the hell\\'s taking them so long?\\nHunter 2: I don\\'t know. They went to check on \\'em. For now, we wait.\\nJoel: C\\'mere, keep your head down. Alright now...I\\'m gonna jump down there and\\nEllie: What about me?\\nJoel: You stay here.\\nEllie: This is so stupid. We\\'d have more of a fucking chance if you\\'d let me\\nJoel: I am.\\nJoel: Now you seem to know your way around a gun. You reckon you can handle\\nEllie: Well, uh, I sorta shot a rifle before...but it was a rats.\\nJoel: Rats?\\nEllie: With BBs.\\nJoel: Well, it\\'s the same basic concept. Lift it up. Alright now, you\\'re gonna\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Go ahead and pull the bolt back. Grab it right there. Just tug it. There\\nEllie: I got this.\\nJoel: Alright. And just so we\\'re clear about back there...it was either him or\\nEllie: You\\'re welcome.\\nHunter: Asshole should\\'ve known better. If you\\'re gonna steal, you better make\\nHunter 2: Right? I would\\'ve done--\\nHunter 3: They\\'re all dead! They\\'re all fucking dead!\\nHunter: The hell\\'s he yappin\\' about? Take a breath. Who\\'s dead?\\nHunter 3: The whole crew. The 76 lookout guys. Some fuckin\\' tourist killed \\'em,\\nHunter: Shit. Have you talked to the boss?\\nHunter 3: Yeah. He wants everyone to hold their ground, watch the gate.\\nHunter 2: Alright, you heard him. Search the area. Do not let anybody through!\\nHunter 4: He\\'s gotta be wrong.\\nHunter 5: About the crew being dead?\\nHunter 4: I don\\'t see some tourists taking out the entire crew.\\nHunter 5: What if they did? Maybe it\\'s the military coming back.\\nHunter 4: Don\\'t be an idiot. Military doesn\\'t give a damn about this place.\\nHunter 5: We\\'ll find them. We always do.\\nHunter 4: I hope you\\'re right.\\nJoel: Alright, come on down.\\nEllie: How\\'d I do?\\nJoel: How \\'bout something a...little more your size.\\nJoel: It\\'s for emergencies only.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nJoel: Now, the safety\\'s on. Do you know how to switch it off?\\nEllie: I do.\\nJoel: Okay, you just...you gotta respect it. This is not--\\nEllie: Joel, I\\'ll be careful.\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Whoa, nelly. Harsh punishment.\\nJoel: Shit. It ain\\'t that much different from what the military does back in\\nEllie: I guess not.\\nJoel: Alright, do your thing, Ellie.\\nEllie: On it. Come on. Stupid chain is stuck. Hold on.\\nJoel: I am.\\nEllie: There.\\nJoel: That\\'s good thinkin\\'.\\nEllie: How \\'bout you get me up there?\\nJoel: Help me open this.\\nEllie: Here.\\nJoel: I got it.\\nVoice: Run!\\nJoel: Oh shit, get down, get down.\\nVoice: Keep running!\\nEllie: What do we do?\\nJoel: Nothing.\\nDying Woman: No...\\nHunter: Busy couple a days, huh?\\nHunter 2: Whatever, man. Damn. No food, old pair of shoes. They got nothin\\'.\\nHunter: Alright.\\nEllie: Oh man...\\nJoel: There ain\\'t nothin\\' we coulda done.\\nEllie: I know...it\\'s just...oh man.\\nJoel: Let\\'s just get to that bridge.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nHunter: Well, at least they finally killed that couple. I was sure they made\\nHunter 2: There better\\'ve been an army in that truck. How the fuck did they\\nHunter: Let\\'s keep searching. I wanna wrap this up by sundown.\\nHunter: Got word from the east side crew -- they ain\\'t seen shit.\\nHunter 2: What about Market Street?\\nHunter: Yeah, they\\'re driving through that area now. Who knows, maybe they\\'ll\\nHunter 2: I pray to god these tourists show their faces.\\nHunter: Fuck, they gotta show up somewhere...I think this\\'ll be your lucky day.\\nEllie: Joel, there\\'s a guy up on that second floor, right there.\\nJoel: Yeah, I see him. Stay low.\\nEllie: Oh man. Endure and survive.\\nJoel: What? Oh, right...the comic book thing.\\nEllie: Geez. I guess this is how it ended for this zone.\\nJoel: Well, every battle\\'s got a losing side.\\nEllie: What if they had families?\\nJoel: Everyone has a family. Best not to dwell on it.\\nEllie: How can you not? Hey -- get me up there. Come on.\\nJoel: There ya go.\\nJoel: We\\'re almost there.\\nEllie: I stayed at a place like this. Back in the Boston QZ.\\nJoel: \"Military Preparatory School\".\\nEllie: Yeah, nice way of saying orphanage. I wonder what happened to all these\\nJoel: This place has been out for a good stretch. They ain\\'t kids no more.\\nEllie: Meaning they\\'re either hunters trying to kill us, or they\\'re dead.\\nJoel: Or they got away.\\nEllie: But you don\\'t believe that?\\nJoel: I believe in getting out of this city. Come on.\\nEllie: There\\'s another one.\\nEllie: These posters are everywhere.\\nJoel: I saw this right before the outbreak.\\nEllie: You did? Did he totally gut her by the end?\\nJoel: Nobody gets gutted. It\\'s a dumb teen movie.\\nEllie: Who dragged you to see it then?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know. Let\\'s just stay focused, alright?\\nEllie: Alright.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get through the alley.\\nEllie: Agh, it\\'s that fucking truck.\\nJoel: It\\'s alright, keep your head down.\\nHunter: Six.\\nHunter 2: Nope.\\nHunter: Seven.\\nHunter 2: Not even close.\\nHunter: Ten.\\nHunter 2: Keep going.\\nHunter: I don\\'t know, twenty.\\nHunter 2: Try twenty-five.\\nHunter: Bullshit.\\nHunter 2: Swear to god.\\nHunter: You have twenty-five cans of bacon?\\nHunter 2: Well, twenty-four. I just finished one.\\nHunter: How the hell do you have twenty-four cans of bacon?\\nHunter 2: Military locker in the hotel, from back in the day. Me and Reuben\\nHunter: And that shit\\'s still good? When are you making some more?\\nHunter 2: Why?\\nHunter: Why do you think? I want some.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, I bet you do.\\nHunter: Man...I saved your ass from that clicker last week.\\nHunter 2: I\\'ll think about it.\\nHunter: I shoulda let your ass die back there.\\nHunter 2: Oh, Jesus. I\\'ll make you some if you quit bringing that up.\\nHunter: It better be as good as you say it is.\\nHunter 2: It\\'s bacon; of course it\\'s good.\\nEllie: What the fuck are they shooting at us with?\\nJoel: I think we lost \\'em.\\nEllie: Oh shit.\\nJoel: We\\'re okay. They can\\'t see us.\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nMan: What the fuck?\\nJoel: Sonofa--\\nEllie: Joel.\\nMan: Wait. Wait!\\nEllie: Joel, stop! Look.\\nMan: Leave him alone.\\nJoel: Easy, on. Just take it easy.\\nMan: It\\'s alright. They\\'re not the bad guys. Lower the gun. Man, you hit hard.\\nJoel: Yeah, well, I was trying to kill you.\\nMan: Yeah, I thought you were one of them too. Then I saw you. If you haven\\'t\\nKid: You\\'re bleeding.\\nMan: Ah, it\\'s nothing.\\nHenry: I\\'m Henry. This is Sam. I think I caught your name was Joel?\\nEllie: Ellie.\\nJoel: How many are with you?\\nSam: They\\'re all dead.\\nHenry: Hey, we don\\'t know that. There were a bunch of us. Someone had the\\nEllie: We can help each other.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: Safety in numbers and all that.\\nHenry: She\\'s right. We could help each other. We got a hideout not too far\\nJoel: Alright, take us there.\\nHenry: Follow me.\\nSam: Sorry about the whole gun thing.\\nEllie: Don\\'t worry. I would\\'ve probably done the same thing. Where you from?\\nSam: All the way from Hartford.\\nEllie: Really? I heard some bad stuff going on down there.\\nSam: Yeah, the military abandoned the zone. It\\'s why we left. Place probably\\nHenry: We gotta be careful. We\\'re right next to one of their lookout areas. Is\\nEllie: We\\'re not related, we\\'re more like, um...\\nJoel: I promised someone I\\'d look after her.\\nHenry: Yeah, I can appreciate that.\\nHenry: Wait, wait. Everyone be quiet. Get away from the windows.\\nJoel: They\\'re gone.\\nHenry: Man...that fuckin\\' truck. It\\'s been hounding us ever since we got in\\nSam: Nothing.\\nHenry: Get rid of it.\\nSam: My backpack is practically empty.\\nHenry: What\\'s the rule about takin\\' stuff?\\nSam: It weighs like nothing.\\nHenry: The rule -- what is it?\\nSam: We only take what we have to.\\nHenry: That\\'s right. Now come on.\\nJoel: How far is this place?\\nHenry: We\\'re close. Real close.\\nJoel: Shit. Ellie, you watch our back.\\nEllie: Of course.\\nHenry: Sam, stay with her.\\nHunter: What\\'d you find?\\nHunter 2: Nothing... Looks like someone was up there, but they\\'re long gone.\\nHunter: So where are the others?\\nHunter 2: They wanted to give it another once over. Make sure we didn\\'t miss\\nHunter: Alright...keep an eye out over there. I\\'ll check this area.\\nHenry: We did it. Not bad, old timer. Come on, up on this truck. Oh shit,\\nHenry: Through this door.\\nJoel: Are you sure it\\'s safe being so close to them?\\nHenry: I\\'m the only one with the key, man.\\nJoel: And where\\'d you get that?\\nHenry: I killed one of \\'em. He won\\'t miss it now. Everybody through.\\nSam: It\\'s back here. So...how old are you?\\nEllie: Me? Fourteen. How old are you?\\nSam: Ah...the same.\\nHenry: Oh, you\\'re fourteen, huh?\\nSam: I\\'m close.\\nHenry: Alright.\\nSam: I am.\\nHenry: Here we are. Welcome to my office.\\nEllie: How long have you guys been holed up in here?\\nSam: A few days. We found a bit of food, though. Here.\\nHenry: Blueberries. Found a whole stash of \\'em. You want some?\\nJoel: No.\\nHenry: Hey, man, relax. We\\'re safe.\\nJoel: So why haven\\'t you left?\\nHenry: Been waiting for the right opportunity.\\nJoel: And?\\nHenry: Here. Check this out.\\nHenry: Look at these sons of bitches. Everyday they congregate down there,\\nJoel: That could work.\\nHenry: Oh, it\\'ll work. It\\'ll definitely work. Wow...\\nSam: Ready?\\nEllie: Ow.\\nSam: A blueberry hurt you?\\nHenry: It\\'s been awhile since that boy even cracked a smile. She doesn\\'t seem\\nJoel: So where were you headin\\'?\\nHenry: Heard the Fireflies are based out west somewhere. We\\'re gonna join up\\nJoel: Yeah...\\nHenry: Somethin\\' funny?\\nJoel: Just seems like there\\'s a lot of people putting their stock on the\\nHenry: Yeah, maybe there\\'s a reason for that.\\nJoel: So you don\\'t know where they are and you\\'re just gonna drag him across\\nHenry: I tell you what, how about I worry about my brother and you worry about\\nJoel: Easy. We\\'re looking for the Fireflies too.\\nHenry: This is us. There\\'s an abandoned military radio station, just outside\\nJoel: I guess we best rest up then.\\nEllie: He says it\\'s time to go.\\nHenry: Now, we\\'re gonna be moving fast, okay? So no matter what, you stick to\\nSam: Like glue. Got it.\\nHenry: Like glue. Good, good. Alright, y\\'all ready?\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nHenry: Okay. Alright, y\\'all stay close, okay?\\nJoel: You tried this before?\\nHenry: Uh, yeah.\\nJoel: That\\'s comforting.\\nHenry: Relax, old man.\\nJoel: I just hope you know the way.\\nHenry: This way.\\nHenry: Okay, let\\'s try to take them out quietly. Hey, I\\'ll follow your lead.\\nJoel: Alright.\\nHunter: Hey...how you doing?\\nHunter 2: Just trying to keep warm. How\\'s it looking out there?\\nHunter: We put down some infected, but no sign of those tourists.\\nHunter 2: Think they\\'re still in the city?\\nHunter: Yeah, they\\'re still around. Alright...I\\'m gonna do another round.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, you too.\\nHunter: Hey, you hear that? Clicker.\\nHunter 2: Yeah, I hear it, but I don\\'t see shit! Woo! Nailed it! Did you see\\nHunter: Not bad. Hold up, there it is! There!\\nHenry: Yo, Joel, there\\'s a guy on that light up there.\\nJoel: I see \\'em.\\nHenry: Alright, we did it.\\nJoel: Henry, give me a hand with this.\\nHenry: Alright. You ready?\\nHenry: Ah, shit. Go!\\nJoel: Oh, no. Hurry, c\\'mon.\\nHenry: Wait, wait, wait!\\nHunter: Hey! They\\'re over here!\\nHenry: Got \\'em. Come on, everyone.\\nJoel: Keep your eyes open, we ain\\'t outta this mess yet.\\nJoel: Alright, check it out.\\nHenry: We\\'re good. Sam, let\\'s go.\\nJoel: Alright, kid, c\\'mon. There you go.\\nHenry: Come on.\\nHunter: Open the gate!\\nHenry: Ah, shit!\\nJoel: Hurry, hurry!\\nHunter 2: They locked it!\\nJoel: Ellie!\\nHenry: Gotcha.\\nHunter: Go!\\nHunter 2: Move outta the fucking way! We gotta ram it!\\nEllie: Okay, we gotta get him up.\\nHenry: Ah...I\\'m sorry. We\\'re leaving.\\nSam: What?\\nEllie: What? This is bullshit!\\nHunter: Hey! Now!\\nEllie: What the fuck, Henry?\\nJoel: Oh shit.\\nEllie: We stick together.\\nHunter: One more time. Punch it!\\nJoel: C\\'mon, into the building! Let\\'s go!\\nEllie: Okay! Okay...\\nJoel: Go...\\nEllie: Oh, fuck.\\nHunter: Go around to the other side!\\nEllie: Agh. How the fuck do we get outta here?\\nHunter: The hell is going on back there?\\nHunter 2: Sounds like they found \\'em. Spread out. They might come through here.\\nJoel: Alright, let\\'s get underneath it.\\nHunter: Fuckin\\' open it! Go! There! They\\'re running to the bridge! Go, go, go!\\nEllie: Joel!\\nJoel: Oh, shit.\\nEllie: Oh, fuck.\\nJoel: How many bullets do you have left?\\nEllie: They\\'re gonna kill us.\\nJoel: What other choice do we have?\\nEllie: We jump.\\nJoel: No, it\\'s too high and you can\\'t swim. I\\'ll boost you up, you run past\\nEllie: Oh, shit.\\nJoel: Oh my god.\\nEllie: You\\'ll keep me afloat.\\nJoel: Ellie.\\nEllie: No time to argue.\\nJoel: Ellie! Ah, damn it!\\nEllie: Joel!\\nJoel: I got you! No, no, no, no...\\nSam: Henry! He\\'s awake.\\nEllie: Hey, you. We\\'re alive. Okay.\\nHenry: See? What\\'d I tell you, huh? He\\'s good. Everything\\'s fine. You know,\\nHenry: What the fuck\\'s wrong with you?\\nSam: Henry!\\nJoel: Get back, son!\\nHenry: It\\'s fine! Hey, hey, hey, hey... He\\'s pissed but he\\'s not gonna do\\nJoel: You sure about that?\\nSam: Stop!\\nEllie: Joel.\\nJoel: He left us to die out there.\\nHenry: No. You had a good chance of making it, and you did. But coming back\\nEllie: He saved me too. We woulda drowned.\\nHenry: It\\'s fine though. I\\'m okay. Y\\'know, for what it\\'s worth, I\\'m really\\nEllie: That was intense. You cool?\\nJoel: Yeah. Let\\'s go find that radio tower.\\nEllie: For a second there, I thought you might shoot him.\\nJoel: Yeah...almost did.\\nEllie: They\\'re alright. I think it\\'s good to have \\'em around.\\nJoel: I think you\\'re right.\\nSam: Um, do you trust him?\\nHenry: Yeah, I do. Hey, don\\'t worry about it. We\\'re fine now, okay?\\nSam: Yeah.\\nHenry: You gotta believe me on this, Sam, alright?\\nSam: Sure.\\nEllie: Hey, maybe we can find something in that boat over there.\\nHenry: Keep your eyes peeled!\\nJoel: Way ahead of you, kid.\\nEllie: Whoa.\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: First time on a boat.\\nJoel: Well, it\\'s a little bit different in the water.\\nEllie: One step at a time.\\nSam: Hey, Ellie. I think we found something!\\nEllie: Let\\'s go see what it is.\\nHenry: Hey, I bet this goes all the way through. Gimme a hand with this.\\nJoel: Alright, same time. Come on.\\nHenry: Let\\'s do it.\\nJoel: Alright, c\\'mon, kids, go.\\nHenry: Alright. Here we go.\\nJoel: You go in.\\nHenry: Okay.\\nHenry: Hey, flashlights out. Sam, stay--\\nSam: Stay close, I know.\\nHenry: Someone\\'s finally learning.\\nEllie: See anything?\\nJoel: Uh-huh. Gotta find a different way.\\nEllie: Joel, we should see what\\'s over here.\\nJoel: It\\'s blocked.\\nEllie: If you can get it open, I can crawl through and clear that door. Oh,\\nEllie: Do you think they\\'ll join us all the way to Tommy\\'s?\\nJoel: Well, I don\\'t know. We\\'re just gonna have to see how everything pans out.\\nHenry: This way. Yeah, looks like there\\'s a path up ahead. Right here.\\nSam: Can we get out this way?\\nSam: Well, I can\\'t swim.\\nEllie: That makes two of us.\\nHenry: Alright, Joel, how do we get across?\\nJoel: Guess we gotta figure somethin\\' out.\\nHenry: Hey, this thing\\'s on some kinda track. Maybe there\\'s a way we can use\\nEllie: Look, a generator.\\nHenry: It\\'s jammed!\\nJoel: Henry, give it a shot!\\nHenry: Alright! Here we go. Yep -- it\\'s working!\\nJoel: I\\'ll go have a look. You keep an eye out.\\nHenry: Joel! You okay?\\nJoel: Yeah! Still in one piece.\\nEllie: Oh -- this thing again.\\nHenry: Oh, there you go. That\\'s smart.\\nEllie: Ahh, I can\\'t wait to get outta this place.\\nJoel: Alright, see if that generator\\'s still got some juice.\\nEllie: Here goes nothin\\'. Alright!\\nSam: Huh. I can\\'t believe that actually worked.\\nHenry: Yeah, don\\'t jinx us.\\nHenry: I gotta say, I\\'m impressed with you two.\\nEllie: Pssh...we\\'re pros at this by now.\\nEllie: Uh...what\\'s up with this?\\nSam: You think there\\'s people inside?\\nHenry: Maybe.\\nEllie: Are we really going in there?\\nJoel: Oh shit.\\nHenry: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\\nSam: It\\'s a sound trap.\\nEllie: A what?\\nJoel: It\\'s a sort of alarm.\\nEllie: I don\\'t hear anything.\\nJoel: Someone used to live here. Don\\'t look like that\\'s the case anymore.\\nSam: Who would stay in here?\\nHenry: Well, someone who thought they could keep a place like this safe.\\nJoel: Ugh.\\nEllie: Oh, awesome.\\nJoel: Ellie, don\\'t--\\nEllie: Ah, calm down. Sam, stand by those posts over there. Yeah.\\nSam: Okay.\\nEllie: Ready?\\nSam: Oh, Henry, did you see that?\\nHenry: Let\\'s keep it down, buddy, okay?\\nSam: Yeah. Sorry.\\nEllie: You hear that? Infected.\\nJoel: Shh, shhh. Quiet.\\nHenry: There\\'s three more heading our way!\\nEllie: Well, I guess we know what happened to these people.\\nJoel: Seeing as how there was a clicker, they must\\'ve been gone for awhile.\\nHenry: We keep moving forward. All we can do is hope that there aren\\'t any\\nEllie: Hey. You think that leads out?\\nHenry: Could be. It\\'s too high for a boost. Maybe there\\'s another way to get\\nJoel: Oh shit. Get back!\\nEllie: What?\\nHenry: Sam!\\nSam: Yeah, I\\'m cool.\\nJoel: That was me. I must\\'ve triggered some sort of safety gate or somethin\\'.\\nEllie: So...this is awkward.\\nSam: Yeah, I know. It\\'s like every time--\\nEllie: Clickers!\\nJoel: What?\\nHenry: Hey, this thing isn\\'t budging, man.\\nJoel: Just go, get outta here.\\nHenry: Sam, you stay close to him.\\nEllie: Henry, we gotta fucking move!\\nHenry: You keep him safe!\\nJoel: Go! Shh, shh, shh.\\nJoel: We\\'re gonna be fine.\\nHenry: Yeah, yeah I know.\\nJoel: Alright, come on, kid. See if we can find a way outta here, yeah?\\nHenry: Okay.\\nSam: You did it.\\nJoel: We\\'re gonna keep going. You good?\\nSam: Yeah. I bet there were a lot of them here. People, I mean.\\nJoel: Looks like it.\\nSam: Look at this place. It\\'s like a classroom. Why couldn\\'t they keep it safe?\\nJoel: Son, I wish I knew. God knows they didn\\'t deserve it. You think you can\\nSam: Yeah.\\nJoel: Go ahead.\\nSam: There we go.\\nJoel: Good job, kid.\\nEllie: Fucking thing!\\nSam: Is that Ellie?\\nJoel: C\\'mon.\\nSam: Joel, that\\'s them.\\nHenry: Sam!\\nEllie: Oh thank god. We gotta keep running.\\nHenry: Doorway -- over there! Sam!\\nEllie: Run! There\\'s too many of \\'em!\\nJoel: Ellie! Get away from the door!\\nHenry: Maybe if we push it together.\\nEllie: Sam! He just crawled through!\\nHenry: He what? Sam, what the hell are you doin\\'?\\nSam: Getting us outta here!\\nHenry: Well, hurry up then!\\nJoel: Alright, go.\\nHenry: Everyone, upstairs. Let\\'s go!\\nHenry: Damn thing\\'s stuck!\\nEllie: Gimme a boost! I can get through that window.\\nHenry: Open it from the other side.\\nJoel: Make it fast!\\nHenry: C\\'mon, Sam, you\\'re not staying in here.\\nSam: What about you?\\nHenry: I\\'ll be fine. C\\'mon. Go.\\nJoel: Get ready!\\nHenry: Fuck. Here we go!\\nEllie: We got it!\\nJoel: Alright, move! Let\\'s go, let\\'s go!\\nHenry: Fresh air...\\nJoel: Oh...\\nEllie: Wha--\\nSam: Look at this.\\nEllie: Oh, are you fucking kidding me? Thanks for the warning on the other\\nJoel: So, where\\'s this tower?\\nHenry: We\\'re close. C\\'mon, let\\'s go. Hey. How you doin\\', little man?\\nSam: That was a close one, huh?\\nHenry: Yeah. Not one of our finest moments, but we made it out.\\nSam: Yeah.\\nHenry: Hey, look at that. Yep, what\\'d I tell you, huh?\\nJoel: Let\\'s find a way around to it. What about you, how you holdin\\' up?\\nEllie: Business as usual, right? When I was with Henry, I took out a couple of\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nSam: It was pretty intense back there, huh?\\nEllie: Yeah. Totally.\\nSam: How\\'d you two end up together?\\nEllie: Oh...a friend of mine, Marlene, asked him to take me to the Fireflies.\\nSam: You seem to get along well.\\nEllie: Yeah, well...now I just boss him around. Isn\\'t that right, Joel?\\nEllie: What was this place like without infected? Tsh...I can\\'t even imagine\\nSam: \"Will shoot on sight.\" Lots of friendly people lived here.\\nHenry: First few months after the outbreak, they had a lot of lootin\\'.\\nJoel: Everyone barricaded themselves in their homes, then supplies started\\nHenry: I was just five when the cordyceps hit. My memory\\'s pretty hazy, but I\\nEllie: What do you remember?\\nHenry: Uhh...barbecues. Parents, they would throw these crazy big barbecues\\nEllie: Oh. Doggies.\\nJoel: You\\'re gonna want to stay away from those. It\\'s not like it is in the\\nEllie: What is this?\\nSam: Oh, this is an ice cream truck.\\nEllie: An ice cream truck?\\nSam: Yeah, Henry told me about these. They\\'d sell ice cream out of the truck.\\nEllie: What? No way. Joel?\\nJoel: It\\'s true. This thing would drive around and play real loud, creepy\\nEllie: You\\'re totally fucking with me.\\nJoel: Um-mmm. Serious.\\nEllie: Man, you lived in a strange time.\\nSam: Told you so.\\nEllie: Agghh...is anybody else hungry?\\nSam: Yes.\\nHenry: Hey guys -- we break when we get to the radio tower.\\nSam: Alright.\\nSam: Darts.\\nEllie: Right.\\nHenry: Hey, Sam...be careful.\\nSam: Yeah...okay. Alright, I\\'ll go first. Damn it.\\nEllie: Oh.\\nSam: Alright, your turn.\\nEllie: Okay. Just throw it?\\nSam: Yeah.\\nEllie: Boosh, I am a natural.\\nSam: Luck.\\nEllie: No it wasn\\'t.\\nSam: That was luck.\\nEllie: Alright, get outta here. You\\'re getting cocky. Here we go. Fuck.\\nSam: Horrible.\\nEllie: Alright...it\\'s a tie.\\nSam: No, no, you clearly got destroyed.\\nEllie: How did I clearly get destroyed? That\\'s practically a tie!\\nSam: Yeah, okay.\\nHenry: There\\'ll come a day when kids can just be kids again.\\nJoel: Let\\'s go.\\nHenry: Fireflies were here.\\nJoel: Yeah, by the looks of it.\\nSam: How\\'re we gonna find them?\\nJoel: I know a guy. My brother, actually. He was a Firefly. Last I heard he\\nHenry: Sounds like a good plan, man.\\nEllie: Ah, okay. You guys are killing me with your downer talk. It\\'s joke\\nSam: What is that?\\nEllie: Just bear with me. \"You wanna hear a joke about pizza? Never mind, it\\nSam: I don\\'t get it.\\nEllie: Yeah, me neither. \"What did the green grape say to purple grape?\\nSam: That\\'s so stupid. Alright, I got a joke for you.\\nEllie: Let\\'s hear it.\\nSam: Why can\\'t your nose be twelve inches long?\\nEllie: I don\\'t know, why?\\nSam: Because...then it would be a foot.\\nEllie: That\\'s so dumb. I love it.\\nJoel: Oh shit! Get down.\\nEllie: Oh shit...\\nHenry: Fuckin\\' sniper... Did you see where it came from?\\nJoel: Somewhere down the street. Alright now...y\\'all stay here.\\nEllie: No.\\nJoel: Before you start -- I need you guys to keep him busy. I\\'m gonna go\\nEllie: Okay. Hey. Be careful.\\nJoel: Come on, guys... Oh, no, no, no.\\nHunter: It\\'s those damn tourists from the city.\\nJoel: Come on, Henry.\\nHunter 2: Thought you could get away from us, huh?\\nHunter: We\\'re back, motherfucker!\\nEllie: Shit! Oh, that was so intense!\\nHenry: You alright Sam?\\nSam: Yeah, I\\'m okay.\\nEllie: Thanks, Joel.\\nHenry: Alright. We did it.\\nEllie: We should move.\\nSam: Henry!\\nJoel: Shit.\\nHenry: Sam, are you okay?\\nSam: Yeah. Yeah, I\\'m fine.\\nHenry: You sure? You seem funny.\\nEllie: C\\'mon, c\\'mon.\\nHenry: Let\\'s move!\\nJoel: Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Oh, no, no, no, no. Oh god...\\nEllie: Joel, you\\'re okay.\\nJoel: Still here. Anybody hurt?\\nSam: Uh-uh.\\nHenry: No, we\\'re good.\\nJoel: Alright, I think it\\'s time we quit this place. C\\'mon.\\nHenry: Let\\'s go.\\nHenry: Shut the hell up.\\nJoel: Dead serious. It was Tommy\\'s birthday. That\\'s all he wanted to do is\\nHenry: Ah, man. I could die happy if I could just drive one around the block.\\nJoel: It was good. It was real good.\\nHenry: Good? Can you believe this guy? C\\'mon, man, gimme details. Describe it.\\nEllie: You know what? You two deserve a little privacy.\\nHenry: No, no, Ellie, Ellie, this isn\\'t just any regular motorcycle, okay? You\\nEllie: Oh yeah? How would you know?\\nHenry: I\\'ve seen it in my dreams... Vroom, vroom, vroom...\\nEllie: Okay.\\nHenry: I don\\'t think anyone from our group\\'s gonna show up.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nHenry: Worst part about it all -- explaining it to Sam.\\nEllie: Well, it\\'s safe to say those two have officially bonded. What\\'re you\\nSam: Taking stock of all the food we found today.\\nEllie: I see... And how are we doing on canned peaches?\\nSam: Did Henry send you?\\nEllie: No. Why would Henry send me?\\nSam: To make sure I\\'m not fucking up somehow.\\nEllie: Psshhh. I\\'d say we all did pretty good back there -- especially you.\\nSam: Well...\\nEllie: Is everything alright?\\nSam: Everything\\'s fine.\\nEllie: Okay... Well... Have a good night.\\nSam: How is it that you\\'re never scared?\\nEllie: Who says that I\\'m not?\\nSam: What\\'re you scared of?\\nEllie: Let\\'s see...scorpions are pretty creepy. Um...being by myself. I\\'m\\nSam: Those things out there. What if the people are still inside? What if\\nEllie: Okay, first of all, we\\'re a team now. We\\'re gonna help each other out.\\nSam: Henry says that, \"they\\'ve moved on\". That they\\'re with their families.\\nEllie: I go back and forth. I mean, I\\'d like to believe it.\\nSam: But you don\\'t.\\nEllie: I guess not.\\nSam: Yeah...me neither.\\nEllie: Oh...all this serious talk, I almost forgot.\\nEllie: There. If he doesn\\'t know about it, he can\\'t take it away. Alright, I\\'m\\nEllie: Damn. That smells good.\\nJoel: Good morning.\\nEllie: Where\\'s Sam?\\nHenry: I let him sleep in for once.\\nEllie: Oh.\\nHenry: Well if you want him to join us, you can go wake his ass up.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nEllie: Sam? Sam!\\nJoel: What the hell?\\nJoel: Shit! He\\'s turnin\\'!\\nHenry: That\\'s my fucking brother!\\nEllie: Sam!\\nJoel: Screw it!\\nEllie: Oh, shit...\\nJoel: Ellie? Ellie, are you alright?\\nEllie: Uh-huh. Oh my god.\\nHenry: Sam?\\nEllie: Oh no...\\nHenry: Sam...\\nJoel: Henry. Ellie, stay here. Henry.\\nHenry: Henry, what have you done?\\nJoel: I\\'m gonna get that gun from you, okay?\\nHenry: Sa...Sa...Sam...\\nJoel: Whoa. Okay, okay, easy.\\nHenry: It\\'s your fault.\\nJoel: This is nobody\\'s fault, Henry.\\nHenry: It\\'s all your fault!\\nJoel: Henry! Henry, no...\\nEllie: Oh my god.\\nEllie: Jackson County. That means we\\'re close to Jackson City, right?\\nJoel: Shouldn\\'t be more than a few miles.\\nEllie: You ready to see your dear old brother?\\nJoel: I\\'m just ready to get there.\\nEllie: You nervous?\\nJoel: I don\\'t know what I\\'m feeling.\\nEllie: So much for this road.\\nJoel: We just follow the river. It\\'ll lead us straight to Tommy\\'s. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: What happened between you two?\\nJoel: What do you mean?\\nEllie: You and Tommy...you\\'re not together, so clearly something went down.\\nJoel: We just had a bit of a disagreement, that\\'s all.\\nEllie: Oh, here we go...so what was it about?\\nJoel: Tommy saw the world one way, I saw it the other.\\nEllie: And that\\'s why he joined the Fireflies?\\nJoel: Yeah, your friend Marlene promised him hope. That kept him busy for\\nEllie: How was it, the last time you saw him?\\nJoel: I believe his last words to me were \"I don\\'t ever want to see your god\\nEllie: Geez. But he\\'s gonna help us?\\nJoel: I suppose we\\'re gonna find out.\\nEllie: Well, with or without his help, we\\'ll get there.\\nJoel: Let\\'s just keep going.\\nEllie: Whoa, what\\'s that?\\nJoel: That there is a hydroelectric power plant.\\nEllie: A...hydra who?\\nJoel: It, uh...uses the river\\'s movement and turns it into electricity.\\nEllie: How\\'s it do that?\\nJoel: Look. I know what it is, I don\\'t know how it does it.\\nEllie: Alright...how are we getting across?\\nEllie: Well, that gets us halfway. If we get the other one up, we\\'ll make it\\nJoel: Alright, Ellie, I need you to--\\nEllie: I know, step on the fucking pallet.\\nJoel: Go on, give it a spin.\\nEllie: Hey, be careful crossing that thing.\\nJoel: I will.\\nEllie: Teamwork.\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: That\\'s too small of a grave.\\nEllie: I forgot to leave that stupid robot on his grave. What should I do with\\nJoel: Ellie...\\nEllie: What? I want to talk about it.\\nJoel: No.\\nEllie: Why not?\\nJoel: How many times do we need to go over this? Things happen...and we move\\nEllie: It\\'s just--\\nJoel: That\\'s enough.\\nEllie: You\\'re right. I\\'m sorry.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get to Tommy\\'s.\\nEllie: Aughh, I\\'m so hungry.\\nJoel: I know, I am too.\\nEllie: Alright, next squirrel I see, I\\'m totally shooting it.\\nJoel: Let\\'s get past this place, then we can scrounge up some food.\\nEllie: Well, if I starve, you\\'re responsible.\\nEllie: Uh...should we head in?\\nJoel: Ah, ain\\'t no way around... Gonna have to cut through the plant.\\nWoman: Don\\'t even think about reaching for your weapon. Tell the girl to drop\\nJoel: Ellie, do as the lady says.\\nEllie: Okay.\\nWoman: Please tell me you\\'re lost.\\nJoel: We didn\\'t know the place was occupied. We\\'re just trying to make our way\\nWoman: Through to where?\\nVoice: They\\'re alright.\\nWoman: What, you know these people?\\nVoice: I know him.\\nTommy: He\\'s my goddamn brother.\\nJoel: Tommy.\\nTommy: Holy shit.\\nJoel: How you doin\\', baby brother?\\nTommy: Goddamn.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nTommy: Let me look at you. You got fucking old.\\nJoel: Easy -- it\\'s gonna happen to you too.\\nTommy: This is Maria. Be nice to her, she sorta runs things around here.\\nJoel: Ma\\'am. Thanks for not blowing my head off.\\nMaria: Would\\'ve been embarrassing, considering you\\'re my brother-in-law.\\nTommy: We all gotta get wrangled up at some point.\\nMaria: Ellie, right?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nMaria: What brings you through here?\\nEllie: Uh...it\\'s kind of a long story.\\nTommy: Why don\\'t we bring \\'em inside?\\nMaria: Yeah. You hungry?\\nEllie: Starving.\\nMaria: False alarm. They\\'re friendlies. We\\'ve been dealing with raids. Lot of\\nTommy: It\\'s been quiet for a few days.\\nJoel: What the hell are you doin\\' here? I thought I\\'d find you in Jackson.\\nTommy: Been trying to bring the plant back to life.\\nMaria: We had it working before, but one of the turbines went south.\\nTommy: We have electricity, Joel...had. We\\'ll get it running again.\\nEllie: No way. You guys have horses.\\nTommy: We got a whole lot of \\'em.\\nMan: Hey, Tommy, gimme a hand with this.\\nTommy: Sorry. I\\'ll be right back.\\nEllie: Can I?\\nMaria: Yeah, of course. He likes when you pet his ears. You ever ride one?\\nEllie: I actually have.\\nJoel: When have you ridden a horse?\\nEllie: Winston, this soldier back in the zone. He gave me lessons.\\nMaria: You know, if you want, we can take him riding later.\\nEllie: That\\'d be awesome.\\nTommy: There!\\nMan: Hey thanks, Tommy.\\nTommy: No sweat. All right, let\\'s continue the tour.\\nMaria: Earl?\\nEarl: Yeah?\\nMaria: Why are you here? Weren\\'t you supposed to head back this morning?\\nEarl: Still waiting on Houser and the rest of the boys to relieve me.\\nMaria: We\\'ll be fine. Just...go home to your family.\\nEarl: It\\'s just a couple more hours. I\\'ll tough it out.\\nMaria: Alright, well take it easy.\\nRadio: Maria.\\nMaria: Yeah, go ahead.\\nRadio: We\\'re in the control room. Steve\\'s about to start it back up. Do you\\nMaria: I\\'d rather eat with Ellie.\\nTommy: It\\'s my turn anyway. I\\'ll go.\\nJoel: I\\'ll come with you. Go with Maria and put some food in you.\\nEllie: Joel?\\nMaria: C\\'mon, Ellie. Let\\'s give the boys some space. I\\'m sending Tommy over.\\nTommy: This\\'ll be the sixth time of them trying to get the turbines back\\nTommy: It\\'s a little faded but it still looks pretty good.\\nJoel: I\\'m good.\\nTommy: You sure? I mean...\\nJoel: I said I\\'m good.\\nTommy: Okay. Well, I\\'ll hold onto it for you.\\nJoel: Tommy, I...I need to talk to you. Privately.\\nTommy: Yeah, okay. Let me just check on my guys real quick. C\\'mon. I don\\'t\\nMan: Give it up. You ain\\'t savin\\' that turbine.\\nMan 2: Oh, I\\'ll get it. Been at it for too long to give up now.\\nWoman: You\\'re new around here.\\nJoel: Yeah, Joel. I\\'m Tommy\\'s--\\nWoman: Brother. Word travels quickly around these parts.\\nJoel: Apparently.\\nWoman: I kind of see the resemblance.\\nJoel: I see.\\nWoman: It\\'s a compliment.\\nJoel: It\\'s a pleasure meeting you.\\nWoman: You too.\\nJoel: What do you do for protection?\\nTommy: The adults take turns guarding the perimeter. We even got an\\nJoel: You still gotta deal with those infected though, right?\\nTommy: Who doesn\\'t? But that\\'s the world we live in.\\nJoel: Well, maybe you don\\'t have to be.\\nTommy: You sound like Marlene.\\nTommy: These two geniuses are gonna bring this plant back to life.\\nMan: We think we got it this time.\\nMan 2: You don\\'t believe us?\\nTommy: I didn\\'t say that.\\nMan: I bet you a million bucks it works.\\nTommy: Sure. Make it two.\\nMan 2: We\\'re almost ready. They just need to finish putting the shield back on.\\nTommy: No rush.\\nMan 3: To the left! Watch it!\\nMan 4: Okay, that\\'s good. Lower it. Slowly!\\nMan 3: Alright...that\\'s good.\\nMan 4: Tommy\\'s here. We good to go?\\nMan 2: Gimme one second. Okay, good to go.\\nMan 4: You ready?\\nMan 2: Go ahead. Hit it.\\nMan 4: Here we go.\\nMan 3: Goddamn! We did it, boys!\\nTommy: Nice work, boys. Somebody get on the horn and give Maria the good news.\\nJoel: It\\'s pretty impressive. Looks like you\\'re out two million bucks.\\nTommy: Alright, Joel. Let\\'s go talk.\\nJoel: That\\'s quite the crew you got here.\\nTommy: They\\'re good men. This place gives \\'em a second chance. It gives us all\\nJoel: I\\'ve been on quite the adventure, little brother.\\nTommy: I reckon it\\'s got something to do with that girl.\\nJoel: Oh, it\\'s got everything to do with that little girl.\\nTommy: Well, go on then.\\nJoel: She\\'s immune.\\nTommy: Immune to what? Oh, c\\'mon.\\nJoel: See, I know...I\\'ve seen her breathe enough spores to take down a dozen\\nTommy: Alright. I\\'ll bite. Why bring her here?\\nJoel: I was supposed to deliver her to the Fireflies... The way I figured it,\\nTommy: I haven\\'t seen a Firefly in years.\\nJoel: But you know where they are. Now I\\'m not asking for much, Tommy. I just\\nTommy: What makes you think I\\'d do this for you?\\nJoel: This isn\\'t for me, Tommy. This is for your damn cause.\\nTommy: My cause is my family now. You ain\\'t talking about some walk in the\\nJoel: Jesus, boy...have Maria get some of your born again friends to do it.\\nTommy: They got families too.\\nJoel: Tommy, I need this.\\nTommy: You want some gear, sure. But I ain\\'t taking that girl off your hands.\\nJoel: This is how you gonna repay me...huh?\\nTommy: Repay you?\\nJoel: For all those goddamn years I took care of us.\\nTommy: Took care? That\\'s what you call it? I got nothing but nightmares from\\nJoel: You survived because of me.\\nTommy: It wasn\\'t worth it.\\nJoel: I bring you the cure for mankind and you wanna play the pissy little\\nTommy: We ain\\'t back in Boston. You lay your hands on me again it won\\'t end\\nJoel: The hell is that?\\nTommy: We\\'re under attack. You still remember how to kill, right?\\nJoel: Yeah...\\nMan: Shit! Bandits!\\nMan 2: Stop \\'em! Don\\'t let them into the building.\\nTommy: Let\\'s get a move on!\\nTommy: You guys see anything?\\nMan 2: We got \\'em.\\nTommy: Let\\'s get to the bridge.\\nMaria: Tommy! Bandits, they\\'re breaking into the building.\\nTommy: Can you get out of there?\\nMaria: No, we\\'re trapped.\\nTommy: We\\'re gonna come to you, just stay--\\nMaria: They\\'re here. Ellie, hide!\\nTommy: Maria! Goddamnit.\\nHunter: They\\'re fighting on the bridge! Let\\'s go!\\nMan: That\\'s all those sons of bitches!\\nTommy: We gotta get to the girls!\\nMan 2: Right behind you!\\nTommy: Joel, do your thing.\\nEllie: They\\'re all dead.\\nMaria: Tommy?\\nTommy: Maria!\\nMaria: I\\'m alright. The kid\\'s with me!\\nJoel: That was too damn close.\\nTommy: You okay?\\nMaria: Yeah, yeah. I\\'m fine, I\\'m fine.\\nEllie: Joel! Oh man... They were coming in from every direction--\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: --then Maria was like \"We gotta run!\"--\\nJoel: Listen.\\nEllie: --and so we dove over these tables and this huge guy blasts in with a\\nJoel: Slow down, slow down. Listen--\\nEllie: And then--\\nJoel: Hey, hey, are you hurt?\\nEllie: No.\\nTommy: Goddamnit. I need to talk to you.\\nMaria: Absolutely not. You tell him to go find somebody else.\\nTommy: Maria, I can\\'t have this hanging over my head.\\nMaria: Do you have any idea how many men we lost here today?\\nEllie: Hey, what\\'s that all about? Does that have anything to do with me?\\nJoel: We\\'ll talk about it later.\\nEllie: Did he tell you where the lab is?\\nJoel: We\\'ll talk about it later.\\nEllie: Later... Right.\\nMaria: It takes one. One fuck up. One fuck up and then I turn into one of\\nTommy: I have to do this. I don\\'t know what else to say.\\nMaria: Fine.\\nTommy: Maria. Maria!\\nJoel: Here we go.\\nMaria: You. If anything -- anything at all happens to him, it\\'s on you.\\nTommy: She\\'s thankful, you know.\\nJoel: Yeah, I know.\\nTommy: I\\'ll take that girl of yours to the Fireflies. You don\\'t have to worry\\nJoel: It\\'s best this way.\\nTommy: Maybe some real good will come of this.\\nJoel: I need to talk to Ellie.\\nTommy: Say again, I didn\\'t hear ya. Joel!\\nJoel: What, what is it?\\nTommy: That girl of yours, she took one of our horses and rode off.\\nJoel: Damn it. Which way?\\nTommy: C\\'mon.\\nMan: I saw her riding on outta here.\\nTommy: Go back inside. Help the others clean the place up.\\nMan: Okay. Be careful out there.\\nJoel: Easy, easy.\\nTommy: There.\\nJoel: Yeah.\\nTommy: See the tracks? C\\'mon.\\nTommy: She couldn\\'t have gotten far. We\\'ll find her. Don\\'t worry.\\nJoel: Stubborn kid.\\nTommy: She usually pull these stunts?\\nJoel: Nothing like this. I don\\'t know what\\'s going on.\\nTommy: She didn\\'t go down this way. Horse tracks. She went into these woods.\\nJoel: Ellie, what\\'re you thinking? There. More tracks.\\nTommy: Okay, good.\\nJoel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\\nTommy: I got your back. How many do you see?\\nJoel: Too goddamn many.\\nTommy: Go around. I\\'ll cover you.\\nTommy: That\\'s all of \\'em.\\nJoel: C\\'mon. Back to the horses.\\nJoel: Tracks keep going this way. Just hope they didn\\'t get to her.\\nTommy: Look, by the ranch. That\\'s our horse. She\\'s gotta be there.\\nJoel: Area looks clear.\\nTommy: Be careful.\\nJoel: Ellie? Ellie?!\\nEllie: I\\'m up here.\\nJoel: Jesus Christ.\\nTommy: I\\'ll keep an eye out. Reckon you guys need to have a chat.\\nEllie: Is this really all they had to worry about? Boys. Movies. Deciding\\nJoel: Get up, we\\'re leaving. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: And if I say no?\\nJoel: Do you even realize what your life means? Huh? Running off like that.\\nEllie: Well, I guess we\\'re both disappointed with each other then.\\nJoel: What do you want from me?\\nEllie: Admit that you wanted to get rid of me the whole time.\\nJoel: Tommy knows this area better than--\\nEllie: Agh, fuck that.\\nJoel: Well, I\\'m sorry, I trust him better than I trust myself.\\nEllie: Stop with the bullshit. What are you so afraid of? That I\\'m gonna end\\nJoel: How many close calls have we had?\\nEllie: Well, we seem to be doing alright so far.\\nJoel: And now you\\'ll be doing even better with Tommy.\\nEllie: I\\'m not her, you know.\\nJoel: What?\\nEllie: Maria told me about Sarah. And I--\\nJoel: Ellie. You are treading on some mighty thin ice here.\\nEllie: I\\'m sorry about your daughter, Joel, but I have lost people too.\\nJoel: You have no idea what loss is.\\nEllie: Everyone I have cared for has either died or left me. Everyone fucking\\nJoel: You\\'re right... You\\'re not my daughter, and I sure as hell ain\\'t your\\nTommy: Get it together. We\\'re not alone.\\nJoel: I got two walking in.\\nTommy: There\\'s more inside already.\\nJoel: Hang back.\\nTommy: Watch yourself.\\nJoel: Alright...house is clear.\\nTommy: Let\\'s get back to the horses.\\nJoel: We\\'re clear.\\nTommy: You want a hand up?\\nEllie: I got it. C\\'mon...\\nTommy: Easy...easy... Whoa... There she is. Kids\\'ll be watching movies tonight.\\nJoel: Where is this lab of theirs?\\nTommy: It\\'s all the way out -- University of Eastern Colorado.\\nJoel: Go Big Horns. Ellie, get off your horse, give it on back to Tommy. I\\'m\\nTommy: What are you doin\\'?\\nJoel: Your wife kinda scares me. I don\\'t want her coming after me.\\nEllie: Sorry for stealing your horse.\\nTommy: Look, come back to town, let\\'s discuss it at least.\\nJoel: Eh, you know me. My mind\\'s all made up.\\nJoel: University Eastern Colorado. How do I find this lab?\\nTommy: It\\'s in the science building, looks like a giant mirror, you can\\'t miss\\nJoel: You take care of that wife of yours.\\nTommy: There\\'s a place for you here, you know.\\nJoel: You good?\\nEllie: I\\'m good.\\nJoel: Adios, little brother. C\\'mon.\\nEllie: So, let me see if I get it straight. If you mess up your fourth down,\\nJoel: Right, it\\'s called turnover.\\nEllie: And if you clear the ten yards then you\\'re back at...first down?\\nJoel: First down, that\\'s right.\\nEllie: Man, it\\'s confusing.\\nJoel: You just gotta play it a couple of times. It\\'ll all make sense.\\nEllie: Okay. None of these buildings look like a mirror to me.\\nJoel: Well, we\\'ll head to central grounds. Should be able to see most of the\\nJoel: Stay, Callus. What kind of name is Callus anyway?\\nEllie: Not my fault you forgot to ask Tommy his name.\\nJoel: Callus.\\nEllie: So, these places...people would live here and just study? Even though\\nJoel: Yeah, study, party, and find themselves. Figure out what they wanted to\\nEllie: What they wanted to do with their lives.\\nJoel: There was a lookout here.\\nEllie: That\\'s a good sign.\\nEllie: That\\'s a giant ram. You guys were like some idol worshippers.\\nJoel: When it came to sports? Hell yeah.\\nEllie: Ooh...it\\'s getting chilly.\\nJoel: It\\'s that time of year.\\nEllie: Hey, over there. Is that it?\\nJoel: Hmm. It does look like a giant mirror.\\nEllie: How many people you think are there? Fireflies, I mean.\\nJoel: Reckon it takes quite a crew to run that operation.\\nEllie: You think there\\'ll be other people my age?\\nJoel: Ahh...I\\'m not sure.\\nJoel: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...what is it, boy?\\nEllie: Sounds like runners.\\nJoel: Stay with the horse. I\\'ll go check it out.\\nEllie: Are you sure?\\nJoel: Yes. I don\\'t want him runnin\\' off. I\\'ll be right back.\\nJoel: Huh, looks like someone jerry-rigged this thing. No juice. I\\'ll see if\\nJoel: And that\\'s that.\\nEllie: Hey, I was thinking...I would\\'ve wanted to be an astronaut.\\nJoel: That a fact?\\nEllie: Yeah. Can you imagine being up there all by yourself? Would\\'ve be cool.\\nJoel: Oh...well, when I was a kid I used to want to be a...a singer.\\nEllie: Shut up.\\nJoel: I\\'m serious.\\nEllie: Sing something.\\nJoel: Ah, no.\\nEllie: Come on. I won\\'t laugh.\\nJoel: I don\\'t think so.\\nEllie: Joel. Please.\\nEllie: Aww...are those monkeys?\\nJoel: Yeah, a whole mess of \\'em.\\nEllie: That was kind of awesome.\\nJoel: First time seeing a monkey?\\nEllie: First time seeing a monkey.\\nEllie: Should we have seen someone by now?\\nJoel: Uh...maybe these guys like to keep a low profile.\\nEllie: Yeah. Maybe.\\nEllie: Hey, look. Fireflies. Joel, look!\\nJoel: I see it.\\nEllie: This is good. First sign of Fireflies.\\nJoel: Alright, let\\'s try that gate.\\nEllie: There it is. This won\\'t budge.\\nEllie: Watch yourself.\\nJoel: You too. Oh, damn it. Spores.\\nJoel: Shit...\\nEllie: Joel! Are you OK? What happened in there?\\nJoel: More infected. I\\'m fine!\\nEllie: Here, come open the gate.\\nJoel: Alright. Let\\'s try the gate.\\nEllie: You did it!\\nJoel: Yeah. Come on through. Scootch.\\nEllie: Those clickers -- you think they were Fireflies?\\nJoel: No...no, I don\\'t think so.\\nEllie: Why would they have infected so close to the lab?\\nJoel: Bill used them as a form of defense. Maybe they\\'re doing the same.\\nEllie: Yeah...I could see that.\\nEllie: No guards. No nothing.\\nJoel: Yeah...I\\'d expect to see someone by now. Let\\'s get inside.\\nEllie: Have you ever been to one of these?\\nJoel: What? A university?\\nEllie: Yeah.\\nJoel: No, not as a student at least.\\nEllie: Why not?\\nJoel: Uhh...I had Sarah when I was pretty young.\\nEllie: Oh...were you married?\\nJoel: For a while.\\nEllie: What happened?\\nJoel: Okay.\\nEllie: Too much?\\nJoel: Too much.\\nEllie: Are we ever gonna find living Fireflies?\\nJoel: We better.\\nEllie: Hey, what about over there?\\nJoel: Yeah. That looks like a way in.\\nJoel: It\\'s rusted shut. We\\'ll have to find another way.\\nEllie: Maybe we can get over it.\\nJoel: Whoa. Alright, not what I had in mind, but it\\'ll do.\\nJoel: Alright, we\\'re inside. C\\'mon, kiddo, gimme your hand. There you go.\\nEllie: Thanks. Let\\'s look around.\\nEllie: How will they do it?\\nJoel: Do what?\\nEllie: Get the cure from me? You think it\\'ll hurt?\\nJoel: No, no. They\\'ll probably just draw some blood ?- it don\\'t hurt.\\nEllie: I\\'ve gotten shots before. They vaccinated us at school. It sucked.\\nEllie: Hello? Where are they?\\nEllie: Yoohoo! Fireflies? Cure for mankind over here! Anyone?\\nJoel: Let\\'s keep it down until we figure out what\\'s going on.\\nEllie: Nothing useful.\\nJoel: Ain\\'t nothin\\' here but a bunch of medical mumbo-jumbo.\\nEllie: I don\\'t get it.\\nJoel: Looks like they all just packed up and left in a hurry.\\nEllie: Maybe not all of \\'em.\\nJoel: Stay close.\\nEllie: There are no bodies.
